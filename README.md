## üéµ How it Works

The application uses a machine learning model to classify your emotion from a live video stream. Here's a breakdown of the process:

1.  **Face Detection**: It captures video from your webcam and uses a face mesh to identify facial landmarks.
2.  **Emotion Recognition**: The facial landmarks are fed into a pre-trained machine learning model to predict your emotion (e.g., happy, sad, angry).
3.  **Song Recommendation**: Based on the detected emotion, the application selects a random song from a curated list and plays it using an embedded YouTube player.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Real-time Emotion Detection**: Instantly detects your emotion from your webcam feed.
*   **Dynamic Music Recommendations**: Suggests music that aligns with your current mood.
*   **Interactive Web Interface**: A user-friendly interface to view the video feed, detected emotion, and control music playback.
*   **YouTube Integration**: Seamlessly embeds and plays recommended songs from YouTube.

## üöÄ Technology Stack

*   **Backend**: Flask (Python)
*   **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
*   **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, ONNX Runtime, MediaPipe
*   **Libraries**: OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas
