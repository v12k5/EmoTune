# Emotion-Based Music Recommendation

This project is a real-time emotion-based music recommendation system. Using your webcam, it detects your facial emotion and suggests a song that matches your mood.

## How it Works

The application uses a machine learning model to classify your emotion from a live video stream. Here's a breakdown of the process in clear manner:

1.  **Face Detection**: It captures video from your webcam and uses a face mesh to identify facial landmarks.
2.  **Emotion Recognition**: The facial landmarks are fed into a pre-trained machine learning model to predict your emotion (e.g., happy, sad, angry).
3.  **Song Recommendation**: Based on the detected emotion, the application selects a random song from a curated list and plays it using an embedded YouTube player.
